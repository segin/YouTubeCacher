0.0.1

## Core Infrastructure
- Implement comprehensive memory management system with leak detection
- Add memory pools for frequent allocations (strings, cache entries, requests)
- Implement RAII resource management patterns (AutoResource, AutoString, AutoArray)
- Add error-safe allocation patterns with AllocationSet and BulkCleanup
- Implement memory error handling with double-free and use-after-free detection
- Add buffer overrun detection with guard patterns in debug builds
- Migrate all existing allocations to safe memory wrappers

## User Interface Improvements
- Complete unification of dialog system with consistent 2-tab layout
- Implement HiDPI and font-aware About dialog with GNOME-style design
- Add dynamic layout system that adjusts to system DPI and font settings
- Fix dialog line endings for proper Windows text control display
- Add debug test buttons for dialog system testing (debug mode only)
- Replace all legacy dialog functions with unified dialog system
- Improve error message extraction for user-friendly display

## Download and Metadata System
- Implement intelligent metadata caching between Get Info and Download buttons
- Fix video metadata extraction during download with JSON parsing
- Add --write-info-json and --print-json flags to yt-dlp commands
- Prevent double downloads and simplify metadata handling
- Add proper video title and duration storage in cache
- Implement enhanced error reporting with detailed error codes and diagnostics

## Bug Fixes
- Fix startup and exit crashes related to memory management
- Fix Base64DecodeWide memory corruption issues
- Fix cached metadata allocation problems
- Fix SAFE_REALLOC buffer overrun detection
- Fix memory manager circular dependency in CreateMemoryPool
- Fix debug dialog line endings for Windows text controls
- Remove duplicate cleanup calls causing exit crashes

## Code Quality and Organization
- Add comprehensive error logging and validation messages
- Improve yt-dlp error message extraction for cleaner user display
- Add thread-safe allocation tracking with critical sections
- Implement proper Windows resource handling and cleanup
- Add memory leak detection with hash table optimization
- Update build system with debug/release flags and dbghelp library linking

## Documentation
- Rewrite README for honest 0.0.1 release documentation
- Remove overpromised features and focus on actual functionality
- Move unimplemented features to planned section
- Convert from AI-generated marketing copy to professional technical documentation
- Remove "Windows only" from limitations (it's by design, not a limitation)

## Development Infrastructure
- Clean up specification documents and remove completed tasks
- Update steering documents for MSYS environment
- Add proper version control discipline with commit/push workflow
- Implement strict compilation with -Wall -Wextra -Werror flags
