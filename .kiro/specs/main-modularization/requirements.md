# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the modularization of the monolithic main.c file (5,804 lines) in YouTubeCacher to improve code maintainability, readability, and organization. The current implementation handles too many responsibilities in a single file, making it difficult to maintain, debug, and extend. The modularization will split the functionality into separate, focused modules while maintaining all existing functionality and behavior.

## Glossary

- **YouTubeCacher_System**: The main application system responsible for YouTube video caching functionality
- **UI_Module**: The user interface handling module responsible for window procedures and dialog management
- **YtDlp_Module**: The yt-dlp execution and management module
- **Settings_Module**: The configuration and settings management module
- **Threading_Module**: The thread management and synchronization module
- **AppState_Module**: The application state management system

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the main.c file split into focused modules, so that I can easily locate and modify specific functionality without navigating through thousands of lines of code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modularization is complete, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL have separate modules for UI, yt-dlp, settings, and threading functionality
2. WHEN a developer needs to modify UI behavior, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL provide all UI-related code in the UI_Module
3. WHEN a developer needs to modify yt-dlp integration, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL provide all yt-dlp-related code in the YtDlp_Module
4. WHEN a developer needs to modify settings functionality, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL provide all settings-related code in the Settings_Module
5. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL maintain all existing functionality after modularization

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation of concerns between modules, so that changes in one area don't unexpectedly affect other areas of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UI_Module is modified, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL ensure changes do not affect yt-dlp or settings functionality
2. WHEN the YtDlp_Module is modified, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL ensure changes do not affect UI or settings functionality
3. WHEN the Settings_Module is modified, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL ensure changes do not affect UI or yt-dlp functionality
4. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL define clear interfaces between modules to prevent tight coupling
5. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL minimize shared global state between modules

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper application state management, so that the application's state is consistent and predictable across all modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts, THE AppState_Module SHALL initialize and manage the global application state
2. WHEN modules need to access shared state, THE AppState_Module SHALL provide thread-safe access methods
3. WHEN the application state changes, THE AppState_Module SHALL notify relevant modules of state changes
4. THE AppState_Module SHALL encapsulate all global variables in a structured state management system
5. THE AppState_Module SHALL provide state validation and consistency checking

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each module to have clear, well-defined interfaces, so that I can understand how modules interact and modify them safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a module needs to interact with another module, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL provide well-defined interface functions
2. WHEN reviewing module interfaces, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL provide clear documentation of function parameters and return values
3. WHEN modules are compiled, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL use proper header files to define module interfaces
4. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL prevent direct access to internal module implementation details
5. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL use consistent naming conventions across all module interfaces

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the threading functionality properly isolated, so that thread safety issues can be identified and resolved more easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN thread-related code is needed, THE Threading_Module SHALL provide all thread creation and management functionality
2. WHEN synchronization is required, THE Threading_Module SHALL provide thread-safe synchronization primitives
3. WHEN debugging thread issues, THE Threading_Module SHALL isolate all threading logic in one location
4. THE Threading_Module SHALL manage all critical sections and thread lifecycle operations
5. THE Threading_Module SHALL provide thread-safe communication mechanisms between modules

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system to support the modular structure, so that I can compile individual modules and understand dependencies clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL compile each module as a separate compilation unit
2. WHEN module dependencies change, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL reflect these changes in the build system
3. WHEN a single module is modified, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL support incremental compilation of only affected modules
4. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL maintain clear dependency relationships in the Makefile
5. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL ensure all modules link correctly to form the final executable
