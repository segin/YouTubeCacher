# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the inconsistent error handling patterns throughout the YouTubeCacher application. Currently, the codebase uses a mix of return codes, NULL returns, and exception-like patterns, leading to unreliable error propagation and potential crashes. This standardization will improve application stability, debugging capabilities, and maintainability.

## Glossary

- **Error_Handler**: The centralized error handling system that manages error reporting, logging, and recovery
- **Error_Code**: Standardized integer values representing different error conditions
- **Error_Context**: Structure containing detailed information about an error occurrence including both technical and user-friendly data
- **Error_Dialog_Data**: Structured information specifically formatted for display in user-facing error dialogs
- **Recovery_Strategy**: Predefined actions to take when specific errors occur
- **Validation_Function**: Functions that check input parameters and return standardized error codes

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining YouTubeCacher, I want consistent error handling patterns so that I can easily debug issues and ensure reliable error propagation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Error_Handler SHALL provide standardized error codes for all error conditions
2. WHEN an error occurs, THE Error_Handler SHALL log the error with context information
3. THE Error_Handler SHALL support different error severity levels (fatal, error, warning, info)
4. WHERE error recovery is possible, THE Error_Handler SHALL execute appropriate recovery strategies
5. THE Error_Handler SHALL maintain error statistics for debugging purposes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a YouTubeCacher user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully so that it doesn't crash unexpectedly and provides meaningful feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a memory allocation fails, THE Error_Handler SHALL log the failure and attempt graceful degradation
2. WHEN a file operation fails, THE Error_Handler SHALL provide user-friendly error messages
3. IF a critical system error occurs, THEN THE Error_Handler SHALL save application state before termination
4. THE Error_Handler SHALL prevent cascading failures through proper error isolation
5. WHEN an error is recoverable, THE Error_Handler SHALL attempt automatic recovery without user intervention

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want input validation functions to use consistent error reporting so that I can rely on predictable error handling behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Validation_Function SHALL return standardized Error_Code values for all validation failures
2. WHEN input validation fails, THE Validation_Function SHALL provide specific error context
3. THE Validation_Function SHALL check for NULL pointers and invalid parameters consistently
4. WHEN buffer overflow conditions are detected, THE Validation_Function SHALL return appropriate error codes
5. THE Validation_Function SHALL validate all user inputs before processing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error context information to be preserved and accessible so that I can diagnose issues effectively and populate error dialogs with meaningful data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Error_Context SHALL contain function name, file name, and line number information
2. WHEN an error occurs, THE Error_Context SHALL capture relevant variable values and system state
3. THE Error_Context SHALL maintain a call stack trace for debugging purposes
4. WHEN errors are propagated, THE Error_Context SHALL preserve original error information and add propagation context
5. THE Error_Context SHALL automatically collect user-displayable error descriptions alongside technical details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a YouTubeCacher user, I want error dialogs to display meaningful and detailed information using the existing unified dialog system so that I can understand what went wrong and take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs, THE Error_Handler SHALL populate UnifiedDialogConfig structures automatically with error information
2. THE Error_Handler SHALL format error messages for display in the existing UnifiedDialog system
3. WHEN displaying error dialogs, THE Error_Handler SHALL utilize the tabbed interface for technical details, diagnostics, and solutions
4. THE Error_Handler SHALL map error severity levels to appropriate UnifiedDialogType values (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, SUCCESS)
5. WHEN multiple errors occur, THE Error_Handler SHALL aggregate error information into the unified dialog's multi-tab structure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a YouTubeCacher user, I want the application to handle YouTube download and caching errors gracefully so that I receive clear feedback about what went wrong with my requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN yt-dlp subprocess execution fails, THE Error_Handler SHALL capture and format the subprocess error output
2. THE Error_Handler SHALL distinguish between network errors, authentication errors, and video unavailability
3. WHEN cache operations fail, THE Error_Handler SHALL provide specific information about disk space, permissions, or corruption issues
4. THE Error_Handler SHALL handle threading errors in download operations without crashing the main UI
5. WHEN URL validation fails, THE Error_Handler SHALL provide clear guidance on supported URL formats

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error handling macros and utilities so that I can implement consistent error checking with minimal code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Error_Handler SHALL provide macros for common error checking patterns
2. WHEN allocation functions are called, THE Error_Handler SHALL provide allocation checking macros
3. THE Error_Handler SHALL offer return value checking macros for system calls
4. WHEN functions need to propagate errors, THE Error_Handler SHALL provide error propagation macros
5. THE Error_Handler SHALL include cleanup macros for resource deallocation on errors
