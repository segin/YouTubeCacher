## Introduction

This feature addresses critical thread safety issues in the YouTubeCacher application. The current implementation has global variables accessed from multiple threads, manual critical section management, and complex subprocess handling with potential race conditions. This enhancement will implement proper thread-safe structures, higher-level synchronization primitives, and robust thread lifecycle management to ensure application stability and reliability.

## Glossary

- **YouTubeCacher_System**: The main YouTubeCacher Windows application
- **Thread_Pool**: A managed collection of worker threads for background operations
- **Synchronization_Primitive**: Thread synchronization mechanisms like mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables
- **Critical_Section**: A code segment that accesses shared resources and must be executed atomically
- **Thread_Safe_Logger**: A logging system that can safely handle concurrent write operations from multiple threads
- **Shared_State**: Application data that is accessed by multiple threads concurrently
- **Thread_Lifecycle**: The creation, execution, and cleanup phases of thread management

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the YouTubeCacher application, I want thread-safe access to global variables, so that the application remains stable during concurrent operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple threads access shared application state, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL protect all global variables with appropriate Synchronization_Primitive mechanisms
2. WHILE the application is running, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL ensure atomic access to all shared data structures
3. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL encapsulate all global variables within thread-safe wrapper structures
4. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL provide thread-safe getter and setter methods for all shared application state
5. IF a thread attempts to access shared state without proper synchronization, THEN THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL prevent data corruption through protective mechanisms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working on the YouTubeCacher application, I want to replace manual critical section management with higher-level synchronization primitives, so that thread synchronization is more reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL replace all manual critical section implementations with standardized Synchronization_Primitive objects
2. WHEN initializing synchronization objects, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL use RAII patterns for automatic resource management
3. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL implement mutex wrappers that provide automatic lock/unlock functionality
4. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL use condition variables for thread coordination where appropriate
5. WHILE managing thread synchronization, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL prevent deadlock conditions through consistent lock ordering

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the YouTubeCacher application, I want proper thread lifecycle management, so that background operations complete reliably without causing application crashes or hangs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL implement a Thread_Pool for managing background download operations
2. WHEN creating worker threads, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL track thread lifecycle states from creation to completion
3. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL provide graceful thread termination mechanisms for application shutdown
4. WHILE threads are executing, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL monitor thread health and detect hung operations
5. IF a thread fails to respond within configured timeout periods, THEN THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL terminate the unresponsive thread safely

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the YouTubeCacher application, I want a thread-safe logging system, so that log messages from multiple threads are properly recorded without corruption or loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL implement a Thread_Safe_Logger that handles concurrent write operations
2. WHEN multiple threads write log messages simultaneously, THE Thread_Safe_Logger SHALL serialize all write operations
3. THE Thread_Safe_Logger SHALL maintain message ordering and prevent interleaved log entries
4. THE Thread_Safe_Logger SHALL include thread identification information in all log messages
5. WHILE logging operations occur, THE Thread_Safe_Logger SHALL ensure no log messages are lost due to race conditions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user running multiple download operations, I want subprocess handling to be thread-safe, so that concurrent downloads do not interfere with each other or cause application instability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL protect all subprocess creation and management operations with appropriate synchronization
2. WHEN multiple download threads create subprocesses, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL prevent race conditions in process handle management
3. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL implement thread-safe process output parsing and collection
4. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL ensure subprocess cleanup operations are atomic and complete
5. WHILE managing multiple subprocesses, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL prevent resource leaks and handle conflicts
