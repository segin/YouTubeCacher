# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature improves the yt-dlp integration in YouTubeCacher to provide better error handling, more robust execution, and enhanced user experience when interacting with the yt-dlp executable. The current implementation successfully launches yt-dlp but lacks proper error handling for runtime issues like temporary directory creation failures, missing dependencies, and various execution scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear and actionable error messages when yt-dlp fails to execute, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN yt-dlp returns a non-zero exit code THEN the system SHALL display a detailed error message with the specific error type
2. WHEN yt-dlp outputs error messages to stderr THEN the system SHALL capture and display these messages to the user
3. WHEN yt-dlp fails due to missing dependencies THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on installing required components
4. WHEN yt-dlp fails due to permission issues THEN the system SHALL suggest running as administrator or checking file permissions
5. IF the error is related to temporary directory creation THEN the system SHALL offer to use an alternative temporary directory

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want yt-dlp to work reliably even when system temporary directories have issues, so that I can always use the application successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system temporary directory is not writable THEN the application SHALL automatically use an alternative temporary directory
2. WHEN disk space is insufficient in the default temp location THEN the system SHALL attempt to use the download directory as temporary space
3. WHEN creating a custom temporary directory THEN the system SHALL ensure proper cleanup after yt-dlp execution
4. IF no suitable temporary directory can be found THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the progress and output of yt-dlp operations, so that I know the application is working and can monitor what's happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN yt-dlp is executing THEN the system SHALL display a progress dialog showing the operation is in progress
2. WHEN yt-dlp produces output THEN the system SHALL capture and display relevant information to the user
3. WHEN the operation takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide a way to cancel the operation
4. IF yt-dlp provides progress information THEN the system SHALL display it in a user-friendly format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to validate yt-dlp functionality before attempting operations, so that I get immediate feedback if there are configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL verify yt-dlp is properly configured and functional
2. WHEN yt-dlp path is changed in settings THEN the system SHALL immediately validate the new executable
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages about what's wrong
4. IF yt-dlp version is incompatible THEN the system SHALL warn the user and suggest updating

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust process management for yt-dlp execution, so that the application handles all edge cases gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN launching yt-dlp THEN the system SHALL use proper process creation with security attributes
2. WHEN yt-dlp process hangs THEN the system SHALL implement timeout handling and process termination
3. WHEN multiple yt-dlp operations are requested THEN the system SHALL queue or reject concurrent operations appropriately
4. WHEN the application exits THEN the system SHALL ensure all child yt-dlp processes are properly terminated
5. IF process creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information including Windows error codes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want yt-dlp command line arguments to be properly configured for optimal performance and compatibility, so that operations complete successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing yt-dlp THEN the system SHALL include appropriate command line flags for the operation type
2. WHEN getting video information THEN the system SHALL use flags optimized for metadata retrieval
3. WHEN downloading content THEN the system SHALL use flags optimized for download operations
4. IF the user has specific preferences THEN the system SHALL allow customization of yt-dlp arguments through settings
5. WHEN yt-dlp arguments cause errors THEN the system SHALL provide fallback argument sets
