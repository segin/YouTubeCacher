# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the memory management concerns in YouTubeCacher to improve reliability, prevent memory leaks, and provide better resource management patterns. The current implementation uses manual memory management throughout with many malloc()/free() calls, complex error paths that may lead to leaks, and lacks systematic resource management patterns. This improvement will implement RAII-style patterns, wrapper functions, and memory leak detection to create a more robust and maintainable memory management system.

## Glossary

- **YouTubeCacher_System**: The main application system responsible for YouTube video caching functionality
- **Memory_Manager**: The memory management subsystem responsible for allocation, deallocation, and leak detection
- **Resource_Wrapper**: A wrapper structure that automatically manages resource lifecycle
- **Memory_Pool**: A pre-allocated block of memory used for frequent allocations to reduce fragmentation
- **RAII_Pattern**: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization - a programming pattern where resource lifetime is tied to object lifetime

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want systematic memory management patterns, so that I can allocate and deallocate memory safely without worrying about leaks or complex error paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN allocating memory, THE Memory_Manager SHALL provide wrapper functions that automatically handle error cases
2. WHEN an allocation fails, THE Memory_Manager SHALL provide consistent error handling without requiring manual cleanup
3. WHEN deallocating memory, THE Memory_Manager SHALL automatically handle NULL pointers and invalid addresses safely
4. THE Memory_Manager SHALL implement RAII-style patterns for automatic resource cleanup
5. THE Memory_Manager SHALL provide allocation tracking for debugging purposes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want memory leak detection in debug builds, so that I can identify and fix memory leaks during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in debug mode, THE Memory_Manager SHALL track all memory allocations and deallocations
2. WHEN the application exits, THE Memory_Manager SHALL report any unfreed memory allocations
3. WHEN a memory leak is detected, THE Memory_Manager SHALL provide information about where the allocation occurred
4. THE Memory_Manager SHALL provide runtime leak detection that can identify leaks during execution
5. THE Memory_Manager SHALL allow developers to query current memory usage and allocation statistics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want wrapper functions for common allocation patterns, so that I can reduce code duplication and ensure consistent memory management practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN allocating strings, THE Memory_Manager SHALL provide string-specific allocation functions with automatic sizing
2. WHEN allocating structures, THE Memory_Manager SHALL provide structure-specific allocation functions with initialization
3. WHEN allocating arrays, THE Memory_Manager SHALL provide array allocation functions with bounds checking
4. THE Memory_Manager SHALL provide reallocation functions that handle edge cases automatically
5. THE Memory_Manager SHALL provide bulk deallocation functions for cleaning up multiple allocations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want memory pools for frequent allocations, so that I can reduce memory fragmentation and improve performance for common allocation patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frequently allocating small objects, THE Memory_Manager SHALL provide memory pool allocation
2. WHEN using memory pools, THE Memory_Manager SHALL automatically manage pool growth and shrinkage
3. WHEN deallocating from pools, THE Memory_Manager SHALL efficiently return memory to the pool for reuse
4. THE Memory_Manager SHALL provide different pool sizes for different allocation patterns
5. THE Memory_Manager SHALL automatically clean up all pools when the application exits

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic resource cleanup in error scenarios, so that I don't have to manually track and clean up resources in complex error paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during resource allocation, THE Memory_Manager SHALL automatically clean up any partially allocated resources
2. WHEN using RAII patterns, THE Memory_Manager SHALL automatically clean up resources when they go out of scope
3. WHEN an exception or early return occurs, THE Memory_Manager SHALL ensure no resources are leaked
4. THE Memory_Manager SHALL provide cleanup handlers that can be registered for automatic execution
5. THE Memory_Manager SHALL handle nested resource allocations with proper cleanup ordering

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be more stable and reliable, so that I don't experience crashes or performance degradation due to memory issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs for extended periods, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL not exhibit memory leaks that cause performance degradation
2. WHEN memory allocation fails, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL handle the failure gracefully without crashing
3. WHEN cleaning up resources, THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL not cause access violations or crashes
4. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL maintain consistent memory usage patterns during normal operation
5. THE YouTubeCacher_System SHALL provide better error messages when memory-related issues occur
